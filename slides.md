# Understanding Chemical Reactions

- **Definition**: A chemical reaction is a process where reactants are transformed into products with different properties.
- **Identification**: Observations during reactions include changes in state, color, temperature, or gas evolution.

**Examples**:

- Combustion of candle wax: Solid to liquid and gas.
- Citric acid and potassium permanganate: Purple to colorless.

# Types of Chemical Reactions

1. **Combination Reaction**: 
   - Two or more reactants form one product. 
   - Example: $C(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g)$

2. **Decomposition Reaction**: 
   - A compound breaks down into simpler products.

3. **Displacement Reaction**: 
   - More reactive element displaces another. 
   - Example: $Zn(s) + CuSO_4(aq) \rightarrow ZnSO_4(aq) + Cu(s)$

4. **Redox Reactions**: 
   - Involves electron transfer, oxidation, and reduction.

# Balancing Chemical Equations

- **Law of Conservation of Mass**: Matter cannot be created or destroyed.

**Balancing Example**:

- Start: $\text{Fe} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4 + \text{H}_2$
  
- Balanced: $3\text{Fe} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4 + 4\text{H}_2$

# Application and Practice

- **Practical Examples**: Decomposition of calcium carbonate, displacement of hydrogen by sodium.
  
- **Sample Problems**:
  - Balance: $Zn + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow ZnSO_4 + H_2$
  - Reaction Analysis: Identify reaction type and predict products.
