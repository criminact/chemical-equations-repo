# Chemical Reactions

### <p style="color: grey;">Processes Transforming Substances</p>

<div class="my-30px">
</div>

- Chemical reactions change original substances into new ones with different properties.
- Reactants and products are distinguished by change indicators like state or color change.
**Examples:**
1. State Change: Combustion of candle wax
2. Color Change: Citric acid & potassium permanganate
3. Gas Evolution: Zinc & dilute sulphuric acid
4. Temperature Change: Quicklime & water

# Components of Chemical Equations

### <p style="color: grey;">From Word to Skeletal to Balanced</p>

<div class="my-30px">
</div>

- **Word Equations:** Simplified reaction description
- **Skeletal Equations:** Symbols and formulas, no balancing
- **Balanced Equations:** Atom conservation with numeric balancing
- **Example Equations in LaTeX:**
  1. $2Mg + O_2 \rightarrow 2MgO$
  2. $Mg + O_2 \rightarrow MgO$

# Steps and Types of Chemical Reactions

### <p style="color: grey;">From Word Equations to Balanced Equations</p>

<div class="my-30px">
</div>

- **Writing Steps**: Describe in words, replace with symbols, identify physical states, simplify.
- **Reaction Types**: Combination & Displacement, e.g. $C+O_2 \rightarrow CO_2$. 
- **Balancing Steps**: Count atoms, balance starting with maximum atoms, check balance.

# Advanced Concepts in Chemical Reactions

### <p style="color: grey;">Double Displacement and Redox Reactions</p>

<div class="my-30px">
</div>

- **Double Displacement Reaction:**
  - Exchange of ions between two compounds
  - Example: $Na_2SO_4 + BaCl_2 \rightarrow BaSO_4 + 2NaCl$
- **Redox Reactions:**
  - Transfer of electrons
  - Oxidation = loss of electrons
  - Reduction = gain of electrons
  - Example: $CuO + H_2 \rightarrow Cu + H_2O$
