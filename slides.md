# Understanding Chemical Reactions

- **Definition**: A chemical reaction is a process where reactants are transformed into products with different properties.
- **Identification**: Observations during reactions include changes in state, color, temperature, or gas evolution.

**Examples**:

- Combustion of candle wax: Solid to liquid and gas.

$\text{C}_{25}\text{H}_{52}(s) + 38\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 25\text{CO}_2(g) + 26\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)$

- Citric acid and potassium permanganate: Purple to colorless.

$5\text{H}_2\text{C}_6\text{H}_6\text{O}_7(aq) + 2\text{KMnO}_4(aq) + 3\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4(aq) \rightarrow 10\text{CO}_2(g) + 2\text{MnSO}_4(aq) + \text{K}_2\text{SO}_4(aq) + 14\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)$

# Introduction to Chemical Equations

- **Definition**: Chemical equations are symbolic representations of chemical reactions.
- **Components**:
  - Reactants: Substances that undergo change.
  - Products: New substances formed.

**Example**: 

- Word Equation: Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide
- Chemical Equation: $2 \text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO}$

# Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations

- **Writing Equations**:
  - Reactants on the left, Products on the right.
  - Use symbols and formulae.
  - Include physical states.

- **Balancing Steps**:
  - Write the unbalanced equation.
  - Count atoms on both sides.
  - Adjust coefficients to balance.
  - Check balance and simplification.

# Types of Chemical Reactions

1. **Combination Reaction**: 
   - Two or more reactants form one product. 
   - Example: $C(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g)$

2. **Decomposition Reaction**: 
   - A compound breaks down into simpler products.

3. **Displacement Reaction**: 
   - More reactive element displaces another. 
   - Example: $Zn(s) + CuSO_4(aq) \rightarrow ZnSO_4(aq) + Cu(s)$

4. **Redox Reactions**: 
   - Involves electron transfer, oxidation, and reduction.

# Balancing Chemical Equations

- **Law of Conservation of Mass**: Matter cannot be created or destroyed.

**Balancing Example**:

- Start: $\text{Fe} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4 + \text{H}_2$
  
- Balanced: $3\text{Fe} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4 + 4\text{H}_2$
